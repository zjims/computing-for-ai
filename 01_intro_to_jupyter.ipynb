    "Jupyter notebooks have two main types of cells: **Markdown** and **Code**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Markdown** cells allow you to use symbols that are then rendered into nicely formatted text, tables, images, etc. [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) was created in 2004 as a plain text languge for generating formatted text that was itself readable in plain text. It is now widely used across many platforms. While there is a base standard, implementations can differ in some details. The official [Jupyter Notebook markdown](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html) documentation provides a good overview. You will mostly not need to create markdown for the *Practicum AI* courses, but it will be used to provide the explanatory information for you as you run the code.\n",

    "* **For Google Colab**:\n",
    "   * Google Colab has a slightly different Markdown editor view that splits the screen. Markdown is shown on the left, and formatted text on the right. You can even use the text formatting tools on the right to auto-generate the markdown. Rather than using the play button to render Markdown, simply click out of the cell and the split will return to the rendered view.\n",
