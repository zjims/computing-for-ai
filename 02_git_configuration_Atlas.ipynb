The overall goal is to set up something called \"key-based authentication\" so that you can communicate with GitHub from Atlas. You will first check whether you already have a key that you can use. If not, you will create a new key. You will then connect your key to your GitHub account.\n",

SSH keys consist of two files: one, the private key, should be protected and remain in computers you trust (for example, Atlas, or your own computer); the second, the public key, can be placed on any computer to which you want to login.</p>\n",
